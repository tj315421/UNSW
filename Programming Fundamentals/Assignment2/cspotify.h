// CREATE LIBRARY
// Create a new Library and return a pointer to it.

// The pointer is allocated memory to point to using malloc, 
// and it is the caller's responsibility to free the memory
// using delete_library (a function you have to implement in Stage 3)
//
// This function has been implemented, though you may need to modify
// it if you change the provided struct library. 
Library create_library(void);

// ADD PLAYLIST - Command: A <playlistName>
// Add a new Playlist to the Library.
//
// Given:
//      - the name of a new Playlist
//      - a Library
// insert a new Playlist node at the end of the Playlists in the Library.
//
// If the given Playlist name contains character(s) other than alphabetical
// characters and/or digits, the Playlist name is invalid and 
// should not be added.
//
// You can assume that there will be no duplicates in the Playlist names given
// as input.
//
// All strings in this assignment are case sensitive and 
// are invalid if they are not alphanumeric.
//
// The first Playlist added to the Library should by default be "selected".
// When a selected Playlist is printed out in print_library 
// (next function to implement),
// the Playlist in the Library should be shown as the selected Playlist.
//
// The function should return one of the following #defines from cspotify.h:
//      - ERROR_INVALID_INPUTS if the given Playlist name is invalid.
//      - SUCCESS if a new Playlist node with the given name is 
//        successfully added.
//
// Hint: You will need to malloc new memory. 
// You will need to come up with a way to make a Playlist "selected".

// PRINT LIBRARY - Command: P 
// Print out the Library.
//
// Given:
//      - a Library
// print out the details of the Library.
// 
// For example, for a Library containing the following Playlists:
//      - playlist1 <--- this being the "selected" Playlist
//      - playlist2
//      - playlist3
// Your function should print the following where each Playlist is numbered 
// to indicate the order of the Playlists in the Library:
// "[*] 0. playlist1\n"
// "[ ] 1. playlist2\n"
// "[ ] 2. playlist3\n"
//
// If Library does not have Playlists, the function should not print anything.
//
// You can assume that the given Library will not be NULL.
// 
// You should use the helper functions given in the starter code to print it
// out, instead of calling printf yourself, namely print_playlist, 
// print_selected_playlist and print_track.
//
// You may need to come back and modify this function after implementing
// Stage 2.
//
// The function should not return anything.

//      - a new Playlist name
// If the given Playlist name exists in the Library, rename the name of the 
// Playlist to the new Playlist name.
//
// You can assume that the given new Playlist name will not cause there to be 
// a duplicate of Playlist names in the Library.
//
// All strings in this assignment are case sensitive and 
// are invalid if they are not alphanumeric.
// 
// The function should return one of the following #defines from cspotify.h:
//      - ERROR_NOT_FOUND if the given Playlist name is not found otherwise,
//      - ERROR_INVALID_INPUTS if the new Playlist name is invalid
//      - SUCCESS if the Playlist was found and successfully renamed

// Go through all the Tracks within the Library and print out the Tracks with 
// artists that have the same Soundex Encoding as the given artist.
//
// The Tracks should be printed in the order in which they are stored in the

// the existing order of the Playlists should be preserved.
// If there are multiple Tracks from the same Playlist, 
// the existing order of the Tracks within that Playlist should be preserved.
//
// There are different variations of the Soundex Algorithm. For this function,
// the following algorithm (set of rules) should be followed to formulate a 
// Soundex encoding from a string;
//
// 1. Retain the first letter. 
// 2. Map all occurrences of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w. to zero (0).
// 3. Replace all consonants after the first letter with digits based on the 
//    following mapping;
//    - b, f, p, v → 1
//    - c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2
//    - d, t → 3
//    - l → 4
//    - m, n → 5
//    - r → 6
// 4. Replace all adjacent same digits with one digit, and then remove all the 
//    zero (0) digits
// 5. If the first digit matches the numerical encoding of the first letter,
//    remove the digit.
// 6. Append 3 zeros if result contains less than 3 digits. Remove all except 
//    first letter and 3 digits after it.
//
// For example, a Library containing:
// [*] 0. Workout
//        - Red                                 Taylor                      02:10

// The function should return one of the following #defines from cspotify.h:
//      - ERROR_INVALID_INPUTS if the given artist name contains characters 
//          other than alphabetical letters or if a Playlist with the same 
//          artist name already exists.
//      - SUCCESS if the Playlist has been successfully added.
int add_filtered_playlist(Library library, char artist[MAX_LEN]);

// REORDER PLAYLIST - Command: r <length>
// Reorder the selected Playlist in the given order specified 
// by the order array.
//
// This function differs slightly in the way in which the command is executed.
// To execute the command for this program, use the command r <length> where
// <length> is the number of Tracks in the selected Playlist. Then the program
// will prompt you to enter an order where you will input all integers from
// 0 to length - 1 without duplicates in a random order. 
//
// Given:
//      - a Library
//      - an int array specifying an order
//      - the length of the order array
// Reorder the Tracks in the selected Playlist based on the order in the given
// array.
//
// For example, for a Library containing:
// [ ] 0. RoadTrip
//        - HowYouLikeThat                      BLACKPINK                   03:00

// [ ] 1. StudyMusic
// [*] 2. Hype
