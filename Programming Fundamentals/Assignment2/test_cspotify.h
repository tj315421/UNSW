// TEST ADD PLAYLIST
// Test whether 'add_playlist' is doing the right thing.
//
// You should 'printf("MEETS SPEC\n");' if 'add_playlist'
// is working as the spec describes. If it doesn't do what
// the spec says it should 'printf("DOES NOT MEET SPEC\n");'.
//
// For full marks in this function, you should test at least
// two different cases of using the 'add_playlist' function.
// One test has already been provided to you, which you may
// keep or modify. It does not count towards the two ways you 
// are supposed to test.
// For instance:
//  - What if 'add_playlist' is given an invalid input?
//  - What if 'add_playlist' is used to add many Playlists 
//
// You should only need if statements and the functions in
// `cspotify.h` to test it, though you may use any C language
// features you have learned. You do not need to free memory.
